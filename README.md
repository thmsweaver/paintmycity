paintmycity
===========

first rails project

this project aims to cover DC in paint.  users will upload photos of their artwork along with associated x,y coordinates, posting their geo-tagged composititons to a central map of the city.  these artists will explore the often overlooked corners of the cityscape, expressing themselves with paint.

this project was dependent upon the google maps for rails gem.

in the future i would like to build this out, offering a more seamless user experience contributing to the organic growth of this project.
